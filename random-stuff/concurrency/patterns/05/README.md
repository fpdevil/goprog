# Testing the pipeline 05

We create a filter for enforcing a condition over the random stream of numbers.  The condition or a predicate can be anything line `finding even numbers only` o `finding primes only` etc.

The counter and the proxyCounter are stages which just count the filtered values passed and the total values passed through the pipeline.

## Run

```bash
â‡’  go run 05/main.go
/// Processor: Golang Concurrency Patterns Counting & Runnning a Filter ///
