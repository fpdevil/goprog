# Concurrency pattern 6 - Fan-In

`Fan-In` can be considered as the opposite of `Fan-Out`.

`Fan-In` can be considered as a function that might read from multiple inputs and continue until all are closed by multiplexing the input cannels onto a single channel which is closed once all the inputs are closed.

Essentially `Fan-In` is a process of combining multiple results from `goroutines` into one channel.

- output:

```bash
â‡’  go run .
