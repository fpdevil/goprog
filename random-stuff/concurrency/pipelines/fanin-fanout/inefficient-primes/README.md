# Prime number generation

A naive and inefficient of generating a stream of random prime numbers using the pipeline approach. The stream is converted into an integer stream and then passed into the `findPrimes` stage. The function divides the number provided as the input stream by every number between `2` and the `number` below it. If it divides (_not a prime_) the value is passed onto the next stage.
