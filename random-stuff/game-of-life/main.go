/*
Conways  Game  of  Life   is  a  simulation  of  underpopulation,
overpopulation, and reproduction. The simulation is played out on
a two-dimensional grid of cells.  As such, this challenge focuses
on slices.

Each cell has  eight adjacent cells in  the horizontal, vertical,
and diagonal  directions. In each  generation, cells live  or die
based on the number of living neighbors.

The rules for Conwayâ€™s Game of Life:

1. A live cell with less than two live neighbors dies.

2. A live cell  with two or three live neighbors  lives on to the
   next  generation.

3. A  live  cell with  more  than three  live neighbors dies.

4. A dead  cell with exactly three live neighbors  becomes a live
   cell.

Rule 1 represents `death  by under-population`; Rule 2 represents
`sustainable life`; Rule 3 represents `death by over-population`,
and  Rule 4  represents  `birth` or  `reproduction`. The  initial
state  of the  game  is  the `seed`  and  all  cells are  updated
simultaneously. Time steps are sometimes called `generations`.
