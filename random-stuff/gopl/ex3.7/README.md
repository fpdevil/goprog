# Exercise 3.7

Another simple fractal uses `Newton’s method` to find complex solutions to a function such as `z4 − 1 = 0`. Shade each starting point by the number of iterations required to get close to one of the four roots. Color each point by the root it approaches.

## Image generated

Here is the image generated running for `200` iterations with a contrast of `15`:
