# Exercise 7.17 | Chapter 7

Extend the `xmlselect` so that elements may be selected not just by _name_, but also their _attributes_ too, in the manner of `CSS`, so that for instance an element like `<div id="page" class="wide">` could be selected by a matching `id` or `class` as well as its name.

```bash
â‡’  go run main.go http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml11-20060816 div div h2

```
