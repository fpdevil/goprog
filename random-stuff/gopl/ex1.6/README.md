# Exercise 1.6 Lissajous curve

Modify the `Lissajous` program to produce images in multiple colors by adding
more values to palette and then displaying them by changing the third argument
of SetColorIndex in some interesting way.

## Lissajous Curve

`Lissajous curves` are also known as `Bowditch curve`

**Lissajous curves** are the family of curves described by the below
reduced cartesian parametric equations:

`x(t) = Asin(t)`

`y(t) = Bsin(nt + c)`

where `0 < c < pi/2, n >= 1`
