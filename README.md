# Random stuff from GO

A series of random stuff which I am playing with `golang` as a part of my continued effort to grasp the language features.

## GOPL

Selective exercises from the excellent book `The Go Programming Language`

[GOPL Exercises](https://github.com/fpdevil/goprog/blob/master/random-stuff/gopl)

## Other samples and exercises

Most of the remaining exercies and code snippets are from books and other 3rd party resources which I reworked and implemented in my own way based on my understanding of the language.
